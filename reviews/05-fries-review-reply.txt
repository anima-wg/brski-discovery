I've added terminology explanation for IP, IPv4 and IPv6 and fixed up all occurrances
of IP, IPv4 and IPv6 to be consistent. This document now uses the "modern"
interpretation of IP, which is IPv4 or (inclusively) IPv6. Older RFCs used IP to mean
IPv4. I talked with ADs, they say both approaches are still valid, document just
needs to explain which semantics it uses.

I rewrote that section, but i am keeping role, but i am now better differentiating
it from service. Pls. check. Hopefully it makes more sense now.

Yeah, what a clusterF..K. I was trying to create references to definitions
of abbreviations in the terminology section and that totally does not work,
so i reverted to just references to the bibliography section. Problem should now be gone.

Ack.

i now say "pledge or registrar-agent"...

But i also rewrote whole of 2.1.3 because the sentences where confusing on second read.
(beyond what you asked for, but hopefully helpfull).

Now always soing BRSKI Join Proxy.

Still no idea why it's capitalized "Join Proxy" and lowercase "pledge" in RFC8995.

Fixed.

No, can not use "-" inside a name because we concatenate variations with "-" to form
variation strings.

I have replaced all instances of "cms" with "cmsj".

I've added the following text at the end of 3.1.6:

Just because a variation name is composed from variation type choices does not mean that
an unspecified variation of (random) variation type choices can work without new implementation
or specification. Or even make sense. This may be the case, or it may not. This is also the reason
why this document specifies a registry that explicitly enumerates all variations that are
known to have sufficient specification and will work.

For example, {{BRSKI-PRM}} is indicated through the variation type value "prm", but it may also requires
enhancements to the enrolment protocol used, which is specified in the variation type "enroll", such as 
new endpoints in that protocol.  The required functional semantic implied by the "enroll" variation type 
value in variations with "prm" is thus a different one than in variations not using "prm". And
{{BRSKI-PRM}} does not necessarily sufficiently specify these enhancements for enrollment protocols 
that may not have been known or specified by the time {{BRSKI-PRM}} was written.

In other words: No, we are fine. "est" does not mean the same thing/spec independent of the
other variation type values. 

> Section 3.1.7
> - OLD "agents", NEW "Registrar-agents"

Fixed all instances to Registrar-Agent(s). PRM draft also still has some capitalization issues.

PRM question: why is there a "-" in these Registrar-Agents, when there is none in Join Proxies...

I've changed all applicable instances of proxy not with Join Proxy. I don't think we need
to prepend BRSKI to the term because RFC8995 doesn't do it either,and we inherit it's
terminology.

Q: Not sure what this means. Rephrase ?

Added.

Right. The draft is currently silent over this "out-of-scope" option, and unless
you want to change that, i'd also like to keep it that way, because it would be
(i fear) a lot more theoretical text (PRM discovery of pledges via proxies).

Added:

Note that while pledges are discoverable in the context of this documents technologies, this section
and its subsections do not apply to discovery of pledges because there is no redundancy involved,
and selection of pledges is also only by their ID and not by their supported variation or context.

The second to last paragraph IMHO tries to define sufficiently solid requirements
that it is well placed here. The last paragraph is indeed more an explanation,
but yes, to short to bother creaing a separate ops section for it.

I just removed that paragraph. Just duplicate ..

Done. Nice!

Done. Good catch.

chatgpt says:
  The best and most standard English in technical contexts is:
  "Perform cryptographic authentication of the credential."
  Why?  "of" clearly indicates that the credential is the object being authenticated.
  This phrasing is widely used in security and identity standards (e.g., FIDO, WebAuthn, etc.).
  It’s precise and idiomatic in cryptographic contexts.

Responding to these concerns, i somehow ended up rewriting that whole section
with a hopefully much better step-by-step description of the process by example.

Right.

I also expanded on the examples for GRASP so that there is now a Registrar
announcement and a matching proxy announcement included.

No:

Sure. Hope this can be done during last call, as i am trying to get this to move ahead.
Much better to have an RFC and needing to do a bis quickly due to more experience,
than have it hang around in a WG without ever getting to the first RFC ;-)
