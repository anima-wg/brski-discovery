Abstract

   This document specifies how BRSKI entities, such as registrars,
   proxies, pledges or others that are acting as responders, can be

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document relies on the terminology defined in Section 1.  The
   following terms are described partly in addition.

   Context:  See Variation Context.

   Initiator:  A host that is using an IP transport protocol to initiate
      a connection or transaction to another host called the responder.

   Initiator socket:  A socket consisting of an initiators IP or IPv6
      address, protocol and protocol port number from which it initiates
      connections or transactions to a responder (typically UDP or TCP).

   Objective Name:  See Service Name.

   Resource Type:  See Service Name.

   Responder:  A host that is using an IP transport protocol to respond
      to transaction or connection requests from an Initiator.

   Responder socket:  A socket consisting of a responders IP or IPv6
      address, protocol and protocol port number on which it responds to
      requests of the protocol (typically UDP or TCP).

   Role:  In the context of this document, a type of entity in a
      variation of BRSKI that can act as a responder and whose supported
      variations can be discovered.  BRSKI roles relevant in this
      document include Join Registrar, Join Proxy and Pledge.  The IANA
      registry defined by this document allows to specify variations for
      any roles.  See also Variation Context.

   Socket:  The combination of am IP or IPv6 address, an IP protocol
      that utilizes a port number (such as TCP or UDP) and a port number
      of that protocol.

   Service Name:  The name for (a subset of) the functionality/API
      provided by a discoverable responder socket.  This term is
      inherited from Section 1 but unless otherwise specified also used
      in this document to apply to any other discovery functionality/
      API.  The terminology used by other mechanisms typically differs.
      For example, when Section 1 is used to discover a responder socket
      for BRSKI, the Objective Name carries the equivalent to the
      service name.  In Section 1, the Resource Type (rt=) carries the
      equivalent of the service name.

   Type:  See Variation Type.

   Variation:  A combination one one variation choice each for every
      variation type applicable to the variation context of one
      discoverable BRSKI communications.  For example, in the context of
      BRSKI, a variation is one choice for "mode", one choice for
      "enroll" and once choice for "vformat".

   Variation Context:  A set of Services for whom the same set of
      variations applies

   Variation Type:  The name for one aspect of a protocol for which two
      or more choices exist (or may exist in the future), and where the
      choice can technically be combined orthogonal to other variation
      types.  This document defined the BRSKI variation types "mode",
      "enroll" and "vformat".

   Variation Type Choice:  The name for different values that a
      particular variation type may have.  For example, this document
      does defines the choices "rrm" and "prm" for the BRSKI variation
      "mode".

2.  Overview

   The mechanisms described in this document are intended to help solve
   the following challenges.

   Signaling BRSKI variation for responder selection.

   When an initiator such as a proxy or pledge uses a mechanism such as
   Section 1 to discover an instance of a role it intends to connect to,
   such as a registrar, it may discover more than one such instance.  In
   the presence of variations of the BRSKI mechanisms that impact
   interoperability, performance or security, not all discovered
   instances may support exactly what the initiator needs to achieve
   interoperability and/or best performance, security or other metrics.
   In this case, the service announcement mechanism needs to carry the
   necessary additional information beside the name that indicates the
   service to aid the initiator in selecting an instance that it can
   interoperate and achieve best performance with.

   Easier use of additional discovery mechanisms.

   In the presence of different discovery mechanisms, such as Section 1,
   Section 1, Section 1 or others, the details of how to apply each of
   these mechanisms are usually specified individually for each
   mechanism, easily resulting in inconsistencies.  Deriving as much as
   possible the details of discovery from a common specification and
   registries can reduce such inconsistencies and easy introduction of
   additional discovery mechansisms.

   Generalization of principles related to discovery and operation of
   proxies.

   Because of the unified approach to discovery of BRSKI Variations
   described in this document, it also allows to use Section 1 for
   document for Section 1 and Section 1, which may be of interest in
   networks such as Thread, which use Section 1.

3.1.  Abstracted BRSKI discovery and selection

   In the abstract model of discovery used by this document and intended
   to apply to all described discoverymechanisms, an entity operating as
   an initiator of a transport connection for a particular BRSKI
   protocol role, such as a pledge, discovers one or more responder
   sockets (IP/IPv6-address, responder-port, IP-protocol) of entities
   acting as responders for the peer BRSKI role, such as registrar.  The
   initiator uses some discovery mechanism such as Section 1, Section 1
   or Section 1.  In the the initiator looks for a particular
   combination of a Service Name and an IP-protocol, and in return
   learns about responder sockets from one or more responders that use
   this IP-protocol and serve the requested Service Name type service
   across it.  It also learns the BRSKI variation(s) supported on the
   socket.

   Service Name is the name of the protocol element used in Section 1,
   unless explicitly specified, it is used as a placeholder for the
   equivalent protocol elements in other discovery mechanisms.  In
   Section 1, it is called objective-name, in Section 1 it is called
   Resource Type.

   Upon discovery of the available sockets, the initiator selects one,
   whose supported variation(s) best match the expectations of the
   initiator, including performance, security or other praeferences.
   Selection may also include attempting to establish a connection to
   the responder socket, and upon connection failure to attempt
   connecting to the next best responder socket.  This is for example
   necessary when discovery information may not be updated in real-time,
   and the best responder has gone offline.

3.2.  Variation Contexts

   A Variation Context is a set of (Discover Mechanism, Service Names,
   IP-protocols) across which this document and the registry of
   variations defines a common set of variations.  The initial registry
   defined in this document defines two variation contexts.

   BRSKI context:  context for discovery of BRSKI registrar and proxy
      variations by proxies, pledges or agents (as defined in Section 1)
      via the Service Names defined for Section 1 and Section 1 via TCP
      and hence (by default) TLS (version 1.2 or higher according to
      Section 1).

   cBRSKI context (constrained BRSKI):  context for discovery of BRSKI
      registrar and proxy variations by proxies, pledges via the Service
      Names defined for Section 1, Section 1 and Section 1 via UDP, and
      hence (by default) secure COAP.

Internet-Draft               BRSKI-discovery              September 2023


   Note that the Service Names for cBRSKI include the same Section 1
   Service Names as for the BRSKI context, hence enabling the use of
   Section 1 with cBRSKI.

   This document does not define variations for different end-to-end
   ecnryption mechanisms, so only the "(by default)" options exist at
   the time of writing this document.  However, the mechanisms described
   here can also be used to introduce backward incompatible new secure
   transport options.  For example when responders start to support only
   TLS 1.3 or higher in the presence of TLS 1.2 only initiators, then
   new variations can be added, such that those initiators will not
   select those responders.

   This document does not introduce variation contexts for discovery of
   other BRSKI roles, such as discovery of pledges by agents (as defined
   in Section 1), or discovery of MASA by registrars.  However, the
   registry introduced by this document is defined such that it can be
   extended by such additional contexts through future documents.

3.3.  Variation Types and Choices

   A Variation Type is a variation in one aspect of the BRSKI connection
   between initiator and responder that ideally orthogonal from
   variations in other aspects of the BRSKI connection.

   A Variation Type Choice is one alternative (aka: value) for its
   Variation Type.

   This document, and the initial registry documenting the variation
   types introduces three variation types as follows:

   mode:  A variation in the basic sequence of URI endpoints
      communicated.  This document introduces the choices of "rrm" to
      indicate the endpoints and sequence as defined in Section 1 and
      "prm" to indicate the nedpoints and sequence as defined in
      Section 1.  Note that registrars also act as responders in "prm".
      "rrm" was choosen because the more logical "pim" (pledge initiator
      mode) term was feared to cause confusion with other technologies
      that use that term.

   vformat (voucher format):  A variation in the encoding format of the
      voucher communicated between registrar and pledge.  This document
      introduces the choices "cms" as defined in Section 1, "cose" as
      defined in Section 1 and "jose" as defined in Section 1.

   enroll:  A variation in the URI endpoints used for enrollment of the

      pledge with keying material (trust anchors and certificate
      (chain)).  This document introduces the choices "est" as
      introduced by Section 1 (to indicate the Section 1 protocol) and
      "cmp" to indicate the lightweight CMP profile (Section 1)
      introduced by Section 1.  It also reserved the choice "scep" to
      indicate Section 1.  This is only a reservation, because no
      specification for the use of Section 1 with BRSKI exist.

3.4.  Variations

   A Variation is the combination of one Choice each for every Variation
   Type applicable to the Variation Context.  In other words, a
   variation is a possible instance of BRSKI if supported by initiator
   and responder.  In Section 1, the default variation is "registrar
   responder mode" (rrm) and use of the "cms voucher format" (cms).

3.5.  BRSKI Variations Discovery Registry

   The IANA "BRSKI Variations Registry" as specified by this document,
   see Section 4.1 specifies the defined parameters for discovery of
   BRSKI variations.

3.5.1.  BRSKI Variation Contexts table

   This table (Table 1, defines the BRSKI Variations Contexts.

   The "Applicable Variation Types" lists the Variation Types from whose
   choices a Variation for this context is formed.  The "Service
   Name(s)" colum lists the discovery mechanisms and their Service
   Name(s) that constitute the context.

3.5.2.  BRSKI Variation Type Choices table

   This table (Table 2) defines the Variations Type Choices.

   The "Context" column lists the BRSKI Variation Context(s) to which
   this line applies.  If it is empty, then the same Context(s) apply as
   that of the last prior line with a non-empty Context column.

   The "Variation Type" column lists the BRSKi Variation Type to which
   this line applies.  If it is empty, then the same Variation Type
   applies as that of the last prior line with a non-empty Variation
   Type column.  Variation Types MUST the listed in the order in which
   the Variation Types are listed in the Applicable Variation Types
   column of the BRSKI Variation Contexts table.

Internet-Draft               BRSKI-discovery              September 2023


   The "Variation Type Choice" column defines a Variation Type Choice
   term within the Context(s) of the line.  To allow the most flexible
   encodings of variations, all Variation Types and Variation Type
   Choices MUST be unique strings (across all Variation Types).  This
   allows to encode Variation Type Choices in a discovery mechanism
   without indicating their Variation Type.  Variation Types and
   Variation Type Choices and MUST be strings from lowercase letters a-z
   and digits 0-9 and MUST start with a letter.  The maximum length of a
   Variation Type Choice is 12 characters.

   The "Reference" column specifies the documents which describe the
   Variation Type Choice.  Relevant specification includes those that
   only specify the semantics without referring to the aspects of
   discovery and/or those that specify only the Discovery aspects.
   Current RFCs for BRSKI variations preceeding this RFC typically only
   specify the semantics, and this document adds the discovery aspects.

   The "Dflt" Flag specifies a Variation Type Choice that is assumed to
   be the default Choice for the Context, such as "rrm" for the BRSKI
   context.  Such a Variation Type Choice is to be assumed to be
   supported in discovery if discovery is performed without indication
   of any or an empty signalling element to carry the Variation or
   Variation Choices.  For example, Section 1 specifies the empty string
   "" as the objective-value in Section 1 discovery.  Because "rrm",
   "est" and "cms" are default in the BRSKI context, this Discovery
   signalling indicates the support for those Variation Type Choices.

   The "Dflt_" Flag specifies a Variation Type Choice that is only
   default in a subset of Discovery options in a context.  The Note(s)
   column has then to explain which subset this is.  Like for "Dflt",
   the signalling in this subset of Discovery options can then forego
   indication of the "Dflt_" Variation Type Choice.

   The "Rsvd" Flag specifies a Variation Type Choice for which no
   complete specification exist on how to use it within BRSKI (or more
   specifically the context), but which is known to be of potential
   interest.  "Rsvd" Variation Type Choices MUST NOT be considered for
   the Discoverable Variations table.  They are documented primarily to
   reserve the Variation Type Choice term.

   The Note(s) section expands the Variation Type Choice terms and
   provides additional beneficial specification references beyond the
   "Reference" column.

3.5.3.  BRSKI Discoverable Variations table

   This table Table 3 enumerates the Discoverable Variations and
   categorizes them.

Internet-Draft               BRSKI-discovery              September 2023


   The "Context" column lists the BRSKI Variation Context(s) to which
   this line applies.  If it is empty, then the same Context(s) apply as
   that of the last prior line with a non-empty Context column.

   The "Spec / Applicability" lists the document(s) that specify the
   variation, if the variation is explicitly described.  If the
   variation is not described explicitly, but rather a combination of
   Variation Type Choices from more than one BRSKI related
   specification, then this column will indicate "-" if by expert
   opinion it is assumed that this variation should work, or "NA", if by
   expert opinion, this variation could not work.  The "Explanations"
   column includes references to the relevant documents and as necessary
   additional explanation.

   The "Variation" colum lists the Variation Type Choices that form the
   Variation.  The Variation Type Choices MUST be listed in the order in
   which the Variation Types are listed in the Applicable Variation
   Types column of the BRSKI Variation Contexts table.

   The "Variation String" column has the string term used to indicate
   the variation when using the simple encoding of BRSKI Variation
   Discovery for GRASP as described in Section 3.7.2.  It is formed by
   concatenating the Choices term from the Variation colum with the "-"
   character, excluding those Choices terms (and "-" concatenator) which
   are Default for the Context.  If this procedure ends up with the
   empty string, then this is indicated as "" in the column.

   The "Explanations" column explains the "Spec / Applicability" status
   of the Variation.

3.5.4.  Extending or modifying the registry

   Unless otherwise specified below, extension or changes to the
   registry require standards action.

   Additional Variation Type Choices and Variation Context discovery
   mechanism Service Names including additional discovery mechanisms
   require (only) specification and expert review if they refer to non
   standard action protocols and/or protocol variation aspects.  For
   example, a specification how to use Section 1 with BRSKI would fall
   under this clause as it is an informational RFC.

   Non standards action Variation Type Choices can not be Default(Dflt).
   They can only be Dflt* for non standards action (sub)Contexts.

   Reservation of additional Variation Type Choices requires (only)
   expert review.

   Contexts table.

   Additional Variation Types MUST be added at the end of the Applicable
   Variation Types column of the BRSKI Variation Contexts table and at
   the end of existing lines for the Context in the BRSKI Variation Type
   Choices.  Additional Variation Types MUST be introduced with a
   Default (Dflt) Variation Type Choice.  These rules ensures that the
   rule to create the Variation String for GRASP (and as desired by
   othrer discovery mechanism), and it also enables to add new Variation
   Type and Choices wthout changing pre-existing Variation Strings: Any
   Variations String implicitly include the Default Choice for any
   future Variation Types.

   When a new Variation Type is added, their Default Choice SHOULD be
   added to the Variation Column of existing applicable lines in the
   BRSKI Discoverable Variations table.  Variations that include new
   non-Default Variation Type Choices SHOULD be added at the end of the
   existing lines for the Context.

3.6.  BRSKI Join Proxies support for Variations

3.6.1.  Permissible Variations

   Variations according to the terminology of this document are those
   that do not require changes to BRSKI join proxy operations, but that
   can transparently pass across existing join proxies without changes
   to them - as long as they support the rules outlined in this
   document.

   Different choices for e.g.: pledge to registrar encryption
   mechanisms, voucher format (vformat), use of different URI endpoints
   or enrolment protocol endpoints (mode) are all transparent to join
   proxies, and hence join proxies can not only support existing, well-
   defined Choices of these Variation Types, but without changes to the
   proxies also future ones - and only those are permitted to become
   Variation Type Choices.

   Changes to the BRSKI mechanism that do require additional changes to
   join proxies are not considered Variations according to this document
   and MUST NOT use the same discovery protocol signaling elements as
   those defined for variations by this document.  Instead, they SHOULD
   use different combinations of Service Name and Protocol (e.g.: TCP
   vs. UDP).

   For example, the stateless join proxy mode defined by Section 1 is
   such a mechanism that requires explicit join proxy support.
   Therefore, registrars sockets that support circuit proxy mode use the

Internet-Draft               BRSKI-discovery              September 2023


   GRASP objective "AN_join_registrar", and registrar sockets that
   support stateless join proxy mode use the GRASP objective
   "AN_join_registrar_rjp".  This enables join proxies to select the
   registrar and socket according to what the join proxy supports and
   prefers.  By not using the same signaling element(s) for variations,
   join proxies can support discovery of all variations independent of
   their support for stateless join proxy operations.

3.6.2.  Join Proxy support for Variations

   Join proxies supporting the mechanisms of this document MUST signal
   for each socket they announce to initiators via a discovery mechanism
   the Variation(s) supported on the socket.  These Variation(s) MUST
   all be supported by the registrar that the join proxy then uses for
   the connection from the initiator (e.g.: pledge).  Pledges SHOULD
   announce sockets to initiators so that all Variations that are
   supported by registrars that the join proxy can interoperate with are
   also available to the initiators connecting to the join proxy.

   To meet these requirements, join proxies can employ different
   implementation option.  In the most simple one, a join proxy
   allocates a separate responder socket for every Variation for which
   it discovers one or more registrars supporting this Variation.  It
   then announces that socket with only that one Variation in the
   discovery mechanism, even if the Registrar(s) are all announcing
   their socket with multiple Variations.  When the join proxy operates
   in circuit mode, it can then select one of the registrars supporting
   the variation for every new initiator connection based on policies as
   specified by BRSKi specifications and/or discovery parameters, such
   as priority and weight when Section 1 is used, and redundant
   registrars include those parameters.

   TBD: insert example of received Registrar annoncement and created
   proxy announcement ??

   Join proxies MAY reduce the number of sockets announced to initiators
   by using a single socket for all Variations for which they have the
   same set of registrar sockets supporting those Variations.  This
   primarily helps to reduce the size of the discovery messages to
   initiators and can save socket resources on the join proxy.

   Join proxies MAY create multiple sockets in support of other
   discovery options, even for the same Variation(s).  For example, if
   Section 1 is used by two registrars, both announcing the same
   priority but different weights, then the join proxy may create a
   separate socket for each of these registrars - and their variations,
   so that the join proxy can equally announce the same priority and
   weight for both sockets to initiators.  This allows to maintain the

   desired weights of use of registrars, even when the join proxy
   operates in stateless mode, in which it can not select a separate
   registrar for every client initiating a connection.

3.6.3.  Co-location of Proxy and Registrar

   In networks using Section 1 and Section 1, registrars must have a co-
   located proxy, because pledges can only use single-hop discovery
   (DULL-GRASP) and will only discover proxies, but not registrar.  Such
   a co-located proxy does not constitute additional processing/code on
   a registrar supporting circuit mode, it simply implies that the
   registrars BRSKI services(s) are announced with a proxy Service Name,
   to support pledges, and the registrar service name, to support join
   proxies.

   To ease consistency of deployment models in the face of different
   discovery mechanisms, Variations and non-Variation enhancements to
   BRSKI, it is RECOMMENDED that all future options to BRSKI do always
   have a Service Name for proxies and a separate Service Name in
   support of pledge or other initiators.  Pledges and other initiators
   SHOULD always only look for the proxy Service Name, and only Proxies
   should look for a registrar Service Name.  Registrars therefore
   SHOULD always include the proxy functionaliy according to the prior
   paragraph.  This only involves additional code on the registrar
   beyond the service announcement in case the Registrar would otherwise
   not implement circuit mode.

3.7.  Variation encoding rules for discovery mechanisms

3.7.1.  DNS-SD

   Currently defined Variation Type Choices are encoded as Section 1
   Keys with a value of 1 in the DNS-SD service instances TXT Record.
   This is possible because all Variation Type Choices are required to
   be unique across all Variation Types.  It also allows to shorten the
   encoding from "key=1" to just "key" for every Variation Type Choice,
   so that the TXT-DATA encoding can be more compact.

   If the TXT Record does not contain a Variation Type Choice for a
   particular applicable Variation Type, then this indicates support for
   the Default Choice of this Variation Type in the context of the DNS-
   SD Service Name.  For example, if the TXT Record is "jose", then this
   indicates support for "rrm" and "est", if the Service Name is brski-
   registrar or brski-proxy and the protocol is TCP (BRSKI Context), but
   also when the protocol is UDP (cBRSKI context), because "rrm" and
   "est" are defaults in both contexts.

Internet-Draft               BRSKI-discovery              September 2023


   If multiple Variation Type Choices for the same Variation Type are
   indicated, then this implies that either of these Variation Type
   Choices is supported in conjunction with any of the othrer Variation
   Type Choices in the same TXT Record.  For example, if the TXT Record
   is "prm" "rrm" "cms" "jose", then this implies support for rrm-cms-
   est, rrm-jose-est, prm-cms-est and prm-jose-est.  This example also
   shows that if the default Variation Type Choice, such as "rrm" and
   another Choice of the same Variation Type ("prm") are to be indicated
   as supported, then both need to be included in the TXT Record.

   In Section 1, a responder does not only indicate a Service Name, but
   also its Service Instance Name.  This specification makes no
   recommendation for choosing the Instance portion of that name.
   Usually it is the same, or derived from some form of system name.  If
   the responder needs to indicate different sockets for differernt (set
   of) Variations, for example, when operating as a proxy, according to
   Section 3.6.2, then it needs to signal for each socket a separate
   Service Instance Name with the appropriate port information in its
   SRV Record and the supported Variations for that socket in the TXT
   Record of that Service Instance Name.  In this case, it is
   RECOMMENDED that the Instance Name includes the Variation it
   supports, such as in the format specified in Section 3.5.3 and used
   in the Variation String column of the Table 3 table.

   TBD: Add an example for DNS-SD.

3.7.2.  GRASP

   To announce protocol variations with Section 1, the supported
   Variation is indicated in the objective-value field of the GRASP
   objective, using the method of forming the Variation string term in
   Section 3.5.3, and listed in the Variation String column of the
   Table 3 table.

   If more than one Variation is supported, then multiple objectives
   have to be announced, each with a different objective-value, but the
   same location information if the different Variations are supported
   across the same socket.  Different sockets require different
   objective structures in GRASP anyhow.

   Compared to DNS-SD, the choice of encoding for GRASP optimizes for
   minimum parsing effort, whereas the DNS-SD encoding is optimized for
   most compact encoding given the limit for DNS-SD TXT records.

4.2.  Service Names Registry

   IANA is asked to modify and amend the "Service Name and Transport
   Protocol Port Number Registry" registry
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-
   names-port-numbers.txt) as follows:

   brski-proxy and brski-registar are to be added as Service Names for
   the "udp" protocol using ThisRFC as the reference.

   The registrartions for brski-proxy and brski-registar for the "tcp"
   protocol are to be updated to also include ThisRFC as their
   reference.

   The Defined TXT keys column for brski-proxy and brski-registar for
   both "tcp" and "udp" protocols are to state the following text:

   See ThisRFC and the "BRSKI Variation Type Choices" table in the
   "Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructures (BRSKI) Parameters"
   registry.

   TBD: This request likely does not include all the necessary
   formatting.

4.3.  BRSKI Well-Known URIs fixes (opportunistic)

   The following change requests to "https://www.iana.org/assignments/
   brski-parameters/brski-parameters.xhtml#brski-well-known-uris" are
   cosmetic in nature and are included in this document solely because
   support for Endpoint URIs is implied by the mechanisms specified in
   this document and the existing registry has these cosmetic issues.

   1.  IANA is asked to change the name of the first column of the table
       from "URI" to "URI Suffix".  This is in alignment with other
       table columns with the same syntax/semantic, such as
       "https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-
       uris.xhtml".

   2.  IANA is asked to change the Reference from [RFC8995] to
       [RFC8995], Section 8.3.1.

   3.  IANA is asked to include the following "Note" text: The following
       table contains the assigned BRSKI protocol Endpoint URI suffixes
       under "/.well-known/brski"." - This note is added to introduce
       the term "Endpoint" into the registry table as that is the term
       commonly used (instead of URI) in several of the memos for which
       this discovery document was written.  It is meant to help readers
       map the registry to the terminoloy used in those documents.

Appendix A.  Discovery for constrained BRSKI

   This appendix section is intended to describe the current issues with
   Section 1 and Section 1 as of 08/2023, which make both drafts
   incompatible with this document.  It will be removed if/when those
   issues will be fixed.

A.1.  Current constrained text for GRASP

   The following is the current encodings from Section 1.

   *  The transport-proto is IPPROTO_UDP

   *  the objective is AN_join_registrar, identical to Section 1.

   *  the objective name is "BRSKI_RJP".

   Here is an example M_FLOOD announcing the Registrar on example port
   5685, which is a port number chosen by the Registrar.

   Most Registrars will announce both a JPY-stateless and stateful
   ports, and may also announce an HTTPS/TLS service:

A.1.1.  Issues and proposed change

   One goal of this document is to define variations such that proxies
   can deal with existing and future variations.  This only works for
   variations for which proxies would need to perform specific
   processing other than passing on data between pledge and registrar.

   Changes in protocol that require specific new behavior of proxies
   must therefore not be variations signalled via the objective-value
   field of GRASP objectives.

   In result, this document recommends the following changes to the
   encoding for Section 1 and Section 1.

           Figure 6: Proposed Encoding of registrar announcements

   In summary:

   *  Circuit proxy operation is indicted with objective-name
      "AN_join_registrar" and IPPROTO_UDP.  The default for
      AN_join_registrar/UDP is the use of COAPs and CBOR encoded
      voucher.  For this default, the objective-value is "".

   *  Stateless JRP proxy operations is indicated with objective-name
      "AN_join_registrar_rjp" and IPPROTO_UDP.  The default for
      AN_join_registrar/UDP is the use of COAPs and CBOR encoded
      voucher.  For this default, the objective-value is "".
